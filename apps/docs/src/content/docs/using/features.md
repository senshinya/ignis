Ignis adds a few additional features to Obsidian, mostly around improving usability in a browser. For example: getting files in and out, and opening things by URL.

## Uploading and downloading

Right-click a file for **Download**, or a folder for **Download as ZIP** and **Upload file**. The ribbon has an upload button for the current folder, and dragging files from your desktop into the file explorer also uploads them.

## Opening a vault, workspace, or note by URL

Ignis reads query parameters when the page loads. They combine: `/?vault=Work&file=Projects%2FPlan.md`.

**`vault`** opens the named vault. Without it, the last-used vault opens.

**`workspace`** opens a saved workspace in the tab. Its layout is stored per workspace name, so different tabs can hold different workspaces without overwriting each other.

**`file`** opens a note once the vault has loaded. The value is the note's vault path, URL-encoded. The `.md` extension can be left off, and a bare note name resolves the way a wiki link does.

The right-click menu on a note has an "as Ignis URL" option that copies a full link with the vault and file filled in.

## Refreshing the vault from disk

The `Refresh vault from disk` command picks up external changes not tracked by Ignis, such as edits made on another machine to a vault on a network share.
