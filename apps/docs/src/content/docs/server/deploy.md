description: Set up an Ignis server with Docker Compose.
---

Ignis runs as a Docker container. These steps set up a persistent instance with Docker Compose, on a machine that already has Docker (see [Requirements](/docs/requirements/)).

## Create the compose file

In an empty directory, save this as `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  ignis:
    image: ghcr.io/senshinya/ignis:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      # match these to your host user (run: id)
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      # Obsidian 1.13+ starts only after you accept its terms statement.
      # Read it at https://github.com/senshinya/ignis/blob/main/apps/docs/src/content/docs/server/environment.md#obsidian-terms, then uncomment:
      # - OBSIDIAN_ACCEPT_TERMS=true
    volumes:
      - ./vaults:/vaults
      - ./data:/app/data
      - obsidian-app:/app/obsidian-app
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  obsidian-app:
```

This maps three paths onto the host so your data persists across restarts and updates:

- `./vaults` holds your vaults, one sub-folder per vault.
- `./data` holds Ignis state, such as server plugin settings and sync configuration.
- `obsidian-app` caches the downloaded Obsidian so it is not fetched again when the container is recreated.

To use a different host port, change the left number, for example `9000:8080`.

Obsidian 1.13 and later only start once you accept Obsidian's terms statement. Read it in [Obsidian terms](/docs/server/environment/#obsidian-terms), and if you agree, uncomment the `OBSIDIAN_ACCEPT_TERMS=true` line. Ignis does not accept it for you.

## Start the container

From the same directory, run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The first start downloads Obsidian and the `obsidian-headless` CLI, which takes a minute or two. Later starts are faster. To watch the download or check for errors, follow the logs with:

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

## Open Ignis

Visit `http://localhost:8080`, or the host and port you mapped. You should see Ignis load in your browser.

## Create your first vault

If a vault is already in the `vaults` folder, Ignis will load it automatically. Otherwise it opens the vault manager, where you create your first vault.

---

## Network access

Local access over `http://localhost` works as is, but reaching Ignis over your LAN or the internet requires a secure context. You can achieve this in two ways:

- [Set up TLS](/docs/security/remote-access/#serving-over-https), with a reverse proxy or `tailscale serve`.
- [Treat your host as a secure origin](/docs/security/remote-access/#running-without-tls) without TLS, per browser.

If you make Ignis available to external networks it is highly recommended that you put [Authentication](/docs/security/authentication/) in front.

## Configuration

The compose file above is a basic setup. For the full set of environment variables, see [Environment variables](/docs/server/environment/).

To tune caching, the proxy, and security from inside the app, see [Settings](/docs/using/settings/).

## Notes

### File ownership

Ignis writes files as the user and group given by `PUID` and `PGID`, both `1000` by default. If your host account uses different IDs (run the `id` command to check), set those two values in the compose to match, so the files stay owned by you.

On a read-only or NFS `root_squash` mount, Ignis cannot set ownership itself, so the mounted folders must already be writable by the `PUID`/`PGID` user. Set it up one of two ways:

- Make the `PUID`/`PGID` user the owner of the folders on the host.
- Export the NFS share with `no_root_squash`.

### Vaults on other mounts

To include a vault stored elsewhere on the host, such as on a NAS mount, mount the folder into `/vaults` directly:

```yaml
    volumes:
      - ./vaults:/vaults
      - /mnt/nas/MyVault:/vaults/MyVault
```

Symlinks inside the vaults folder are followed only if the link target exists inside the container. Mount the target at the same path it has on the host:

```yaml
    volumes:
      - ./vaults:/vaults # contains symlink: MyVault -> /mnt/nas/Obsidian/MyVault
      - /mnt/nas/Obsidian:/mnt/nas/Obsidian
```

The startup log lists the vaults that were found. A folder that could not be read is skipped, with a `[config] Skipping unreadable vault entry` line giving the reason.

### Network filesystems

Network filesystems have some constraints that can result in performance issues with large vaults. If a vault on an NFS or SMB mount feels slow, increasing the `UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE` environment variable can help avoid congestion by letting Ignis run more file operations concurrently:

```yaml
    environment:
      - UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE=64 # default is 4
```

Ignis also watches every file in an open vault for changes, and the number of files that can be watched is decided by the host system. If you see startup errors mentioning `fs.inotify.max_user_watches`, you can try raising the limit on the host machine:

```sh
sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288
```

### Offline install

If the container cannot reach the internet on first run, you can download the Obsidian `.deb` from [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/download) manually, mount it, and point `OBSIDIAN_PACKAGE` at it:

```yaml
    volumes:
      - ./obsidian.deb:/packages/obsidian.deb:ro
    environment:
      - OBSIDIAN_PACKAGE=/packages/obsidian.deb
```

Ignis will unpack the local copy instead of downloading. It's recommended to match the Obsidian version the Ignis release pins.

### Backups

Your vaults are ordinary files under `vaults`. Back them up with whatever you use for other server data. Ignis has no built-in backup.

### Running a public demo

To run a public, throwaway demo instance instead of a private server, see [`examples/demo/`](https://github.com/Nystik-gh/ignis/tree/main/apps/ignis-server/examples/demo) in the repository.
