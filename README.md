## What is this

Ignis is a compatibility shim that provides browser-compatible implementations of the Electron APIs used by Obsidian, allowing Obsidian to run in a standard browser while keeping your vault on the server. Obsidian is not included in or distributed with this project. The Docker container downloads Obsidian directly from its official source on first run.

### Why

While Obsidian's local-first approach works well for most users, options for accessing your own Obsidian installation remotely have been limited to VNC-based solutions with poor user experience. Ignis provides an alternative for users who want to access their own copy of Obsidian from a browser, in a close-to-native format.

### Project Status

Ignis is under active development as my daily driver for note taking. It's still a new project, so gaps get documented and fixed as I go. You can look at the [roadmap](https://ignis.thiefling.com/docs/roadmap/) for an overview of major planned fixes and features.

## Quick start

Run Ignis with Docker Compose. Use the following compose file for a basic setup.

```yaml
services:
  ignis:
    image: ghcr.io/senshinya/ignis:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      # match these to your host user (run: id)
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      # Obsidian 1.13+ starts only after you accept its terms statement.
      # Read it at https://github.com/senshinya/ignis/blob/main/apps/docs/src/content/docs/server/environment.md#obsidian-terms, then uncomment:
      # - OBSIDIAN_ACCEPT_TERMS=true
    volumes:
      - ./vaults:/vaults
      - ./data:/app/data
      - obsidian-app:/app/obsidian-app
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  obsidian-app:
```

Save it as `docker-compose.yml`. Obsidian 1.13 and later only start once the server operator accepts Obsidian's [terms statement](https://github.com/senshinya/ignis/blob/main/apps/docs/src/content/docs/server/environment.md#obsidian-terms); read it, and if you agree, uncomment `OBSIDIAN_ACCEPT_TERMS=true`. Then run `docker compose up -d` and open `http://localhost:8080`. The first start pulls Obsidian from its official source, so give it a minute or two. With no vaults yet, Ignis opens the vault manager to create your first one.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before exposing Ignis to other machines, put authentication in front of it and serve it over HTTPS. It has no built-in auth, so anyone who reaches an open instance can read and write the whole vault, and outside a secure context (HTTPS, or `localhost`) the browser disables features Ignis needs. See [Remote access](https://ignis.thiefling.com/docs/security/remote-access/) and [Authentication](https://ignis.thiefling.com/docs/security/authentication/).

Full setup and configuration are in the [deploy guide](https://ignis.thiefling.com/docs/server/deploy/); the rest of the [documentation](https://ignis.thiefling.com/docs/) covers settings, security, and operations.

## Variants

Ignis currently ships as a self-hosted server, with a desktop plugin variant planned. The server variant lives in [`apps/ignis-server/`](apps/ignis-server/); setup is in the [documentation](https://ignis.thiefling.com/docs/server/deploy/).

## Features

- Core Obsidian: editor, canvas, bases, command palette, context menus, themes, and CSS snippets.
- Most community plugins built on Obsidian's plugin API. Plugins needing Node native modules or `child_process` do not load.
- File upload (ribbon, right-click, drag-and-drop) and download (files, or folders as ZIP).
- Multi-vault support with create, open, switch, rename, and delete, and a different vault per browser tab.
- Live sync between tabs over WebSocket, so edits propagate within a second.
- Saved workspaces opened in separate tabs via a `?workspace=` URL parameter.
- Notes can be opened directly by URL via a `?file=` parameter, with an "as Ignis URL" option in the note menu 'Copy path' section.
- Obsidian Sync in a logged-in tab, or server-side Headless Sync that runs without a tab open.
- A cross-origin proxy for plugin requests, with a direct-fetch allowlist for CORS-friendly hosts.
- A mobile UI on small screens.

See the [documentation](https://ignis.thiefling.com/docs/) for the full feature set and setup.

## Limitations

Running Obsidian in a browser means some Electron and Node capabilities have no equivalent, so certain plugins and features are limited or unavailable. See [Limitations](https://ignis.thiefling.com/docs/using/limitations/) and [Plugin compatibility](https://ignis.thiefling.com/docs/using/plugin-compatibility/) for details.

## Performance

A few design decisions worth knowing about for someone evaluating Ignis against large vaults or slow storage:

- A pre-compressed bootstrap response delivers vault info, vault list, metadata tree, and plugin list in a single call.
- The vault file tree is kept up to date by live file events.
- Indexer pre-fetch warms the content cache so Obsidian's startup index hits cache instead of the network.
- An LRU content cache (50 MB by default) keeps memory use bounded regardless of vault size, so Ignis doesn't hold the whole vault in memory.
- Paths can be excluded from file watching to reduce watcher load on large vaults.
- Optional write coalescing debounces rapid writes for slow filesystems (rclone, FUSE, NFS, SMB); off unless `WRITE_COALESCE_MS` is set.

See [Settings](https://ignis.thiefling.com/docs/using/settings/) for more in-depth descriptions.

Ignis is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or associated with Dynalist Inc. or Obsidian. It is an independently developed interoperability tool and contains no Obsidian source code, binaries, or assets.
