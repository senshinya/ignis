# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.9.1] (2026-09-17)

### Changed

- Ignis tells Obsidian the window has a native frame, since the browser draws it. No space is reserved for a desktop title bar, macOS traffic lights, or window controls, and the sidebar toggles sit in the top corners on every platform.

### Fixed

- On macOS, the top-left corner no longer shows an empty block with themes that move the ribbon below the header, such as AnuPpuccin's border layout.

## [0.9.0] (2026-09-16)

### Added

- `OBSIDIAN_ACCEPT_TERMS` env var. Obsidian 1.13 and later only start after the host confirms Obsidian's terms statement; Ignis confirms it only when the operator sets this to `true`. Without it, the browser shows the statement and how to accept it, and the server logs a warning on startup. See [Obsidian terms](apps/docs/src/content/docs/server/environment.md#obsidian-terms).
- GitHub Actions workflow that tests and publishes the multi-arch image to `ghcr.io/senshinya/ignis` on a version tag.

### Changed

- Obsidian pinned at 1.13.7. Existing deployments must set `OBSIDIAN_ACCEPT_TERMS=true` after reading the statement, or Obsidian will not start.
- The published image, the update check, and the repository link in Ignis settings point at `senshinya/ignis`.
- Settings always open inside the page; Obsidian 1.13's option to open settings in a separate window is hidden, since a browser tab cannot render it. The stored vault value is left untouched for desktop installs.

### Fixed

- Obsidian 1.13 takes its OS from the browser again, so the Mod key is Cmd on macOS; `process.platform` stays `linux`.
- Zoom commands and the zoom level setting work with Obsidian 1.13, within Electron's zoom range.
- Pending edits are saved when the tab reloads under Obsidian 1.13.
- Obsidian's startup case-sensitivity check no longer leaves `.OBSIDIANTEST` in the vault root. A sync write and unlink of one path now reach the server in order, and a delete drops writes still buffered or retrying for that path.

## [0.8.10] - Karm (2026-08-20)

### Changed

- Faster boot: the vault file tree is served from a pre-compressed cache, and the client only resyncs metadata when it has changed.
- Vault watchers stop after 10 minutes idle instead of on the last disconnect.
- Improved watcher logs.
- Write coalescing is more robust. Failed saves show error.

### Fixed

- Images and attachments that fail to load are retried.
- Vault rename and remove are more reliable.
- Renaming a vault to an existing name is rejected.
- Websocket properly handles malformed frames.
- `Buffer` handles base64, hex, and latin1 encodings correctly.

## [0.8.9] - Karm (2026-07-30)

### Added

- Open a note via URL with the `?file=` query parameter, Added "as Ignis URL" option under 'Copy path' menu.
- `queryLocalFonts` shim, `crypto.randomUUID` and `crypto.subtle.digest` shims for plain HTTP access.
- Indicator notices for when a save is in-flight and save completion.
- Block input while a note is loading over a slow connection.

### Changed

- Better warning and info when accessing in an insecure context.
- Improved error messages for the proxy providing explanations for why a connection is blocked.
- Updating to a new Obsidian version is now smoother.
- Clipboard support improved over plain HTTP.

### Fixed

- Desktop Node APIs are no longer blocked on mobile
- The vault switcher now functions in mobile mode.
- Vault no longer loads from a stale browser-cached state.
- `fs.utimes` bug fixed.

## [0.8.8] - Karm (2026-07-05)

### Added

- Failed writes are retried in the background, with a status bar item for pending and failed writes.
- A symlink under `VAULT_ROOT` pointing at a directory is discovered as a vault.

### Changed

- Boot prefetch skips plugin asset directories and reads batches in parallel.
- A `chown` that fails on startup (read-only or NFS `root_squash` mounts) logs a warning instead of aborting.
- The "Spellcheck languages" setting is disabled, with a link to the browser's own language settings.

### Fixed

- WebDAV uploads through the cross-origin proxy no longer corrupt; the proxy recomputes `Content-Length` for the request body.

### Security

- `resolveVaultPath` resolves symlinks and confines each access to the vault's real path.

## [0.8.7] - Karm (2026-06-19)

### Added

- Direct-fetch host allowlist: hosts the browser fetches directly instead of through the cross-origin proxy, for CORS-friendly hosts.
- Insecure-context banner: warns when Ignis is served over plain HTTP at a non-localhost origin, where the browser disables crypto and clipboard APIs.

### Changed

- Boot prefetch warms the cache before Obsidian boots; Obsidian's static assets are served immutable.
- WebSocket heartbeat keeps live-sync connections alive through idle proxies, and the client resyncs its cache on reconnect.
- Small writes use `fetch` keepalive to survive page dismissal.

### Fixed

- Missing reads are answered from the cache instead of round-tripping.
- A blocked `window.close()` no longer strands the user on Obsidian's "Saving..." overlay.
- `mkdir`/`rmdir` resolve their path like other filesystem operations.

### Security

- Server error responses no longer include absolute server paths.
- `?workspace=` is validated; zip export skips symlinks; demo-mode vault names and quotas are enforced.

## [0.8.6] - Karm (2026-06-12)

### Added

- `OBSIDIAN_PACKAGE` env var: unpack a pre-placed `.deb`, `.asar.gz`, or `.asar` on first run instead of downloading, for offline or restricted networks.
- `PROXY_ALLOW_PRIVATE_HOSTS` env var: IPs or IPv4 CIDRs the cross-origin proxy may reach despite the private-address block.

### Changed

- `fs.promises.realpath` is answered from the client-side cache; vault load no longer issues one realpath request per folder.

### Fixed

- Sync file reads serve virtual plugin files the same as async reads.

### Security

- Cross-origin proxy rewritten for better security
- Filesystem and vault error responses no longer include absolute server paths.
- Protocol-relative (`//host`) requests route through the proxy guard.
- Vault names are validated on creation; `batch-read` caps the number of paths per request.
- Demo mode: `/api/ext/*` blocked, and several security fixes
- The `ob` CLI is spawned without a shell.
- Dependency bumps clearing npm audit.

## [0.8.5] - Karm (2026-06-07)

### Added

- Server settings panel in the Ignis settings tab.
- `assert`, `constants`, and `stream` shims, plus callback-style `fs` methods and `realpath`.

### Changed

- Write coalescing is now off by default (`WRITE_COALESCE_MS=0`).

### Fixed

- Native menus now stay disabled on platforms where its default is true
- `/app/data` is now created and owned by the runtime user.
- Caddy reverse-proxy example uses the current `basic_auth` directive.

### Security

- Cross-origin proxy rejects requests that resolve to private, loopback, or link-local addresses (SSRF guard).

## [0.8.4] - Karm (2026-06-03)

### Fixed

- Codeblocks calling clipboard APIs no longer causes reccursion error.

### Security

- Hardened same-origin checks, virtual-plugin URL validation, token file permissions, and log line bounds.

## [0.8.3] - Karm (2026-06-01)

### Added

- `WS_ORIGINS` env var to restrict allowed `Origin` headers on WebSocket connections.

### Fixed

- Ignis version is now rendered correctly.
- Tables in editing mode now render correctly in Firefox.

## [0.8.2] - Karm (2026-05-23)

### Fixed

- Various app menus crash when "Use native menus" enabled. Solved by forcing the setting off internally; the on-disk value is preserved across toggles.
- `/api/fs/rename` and `/api/fs/copyFile` reject missing path fields with 400 instead of silently resolving to the vault root.

## [0.8.1] - Karm (2026-05-17)

### Added

- "Available version" indicator in Ignis settings now links to the release page on GitHub.

### Fixed

- Update check no longer reports a new version available when only the SemVer build metadata differs.

## [0.8.0] - Karm (2026-05-16)

### Added

- Demo mode: per-session vaults, auto-cleanup, proxy allowlist, login blocking. See [examples/demo/](https://github.com/Nystik-gh/ignis/tree/main/apps/ignis-server/examples/demo).
- No-op guard in the bridge plugin and headless-sync plugin when loaded outside Ignis.
- "Open workspace in new tab" command now loads the workspace preset rather than the per-tab live state.
- Real digests for `crypto.createHash` (SHA-1/SHA-256/SHA-512/MD5) via `@noble/hashes`.
- `LEGAL.md` with the full EU Software Directive rationale.

### Changed

- Obsidian pinned at 1.12.7.
- Entrypoint downloads `.asar.gz` instead of `.deb`. Smaller image, simpler extraction.
- FS shim path translation moved from the transport layer up to the shim's public surface, so caches and metadata operate only on physical paths.
- Readme cleanup.

### Fixed

- `navigator.vibrate` made conditional. Firefox setups with `dom.vibrator.enabled` off no longer hit a `TypeError`.
- Write coalescer no longer holds HTTP responses open for the full debounce window. Buffered writes return immediately with synthetic mtime/size; only the first/stale writes wait on disk.
- Prefetch race in workspaces-per-tab resolved by the path-translation refactor.
